        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a Systems Administrator, that likes to dabble in all aspects of IT. 
            Everything from Server & Network Administration/Engineering to my newest fixation AI LLMs and AI Agents.
            I wanted to create this site as a place to dump my 11 years of notes from the different companies I've had the pleasure working for, 
            and as a place to gather and organize my current, stalled, and back-burner projects.
        </p>
        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            My current obsession is AI and Azure Infrastructure.
            I'm currently building a Ollama server, and building out a Azure VPC to host the server so my family, friends, and myself can access LLMs anywhere
            without the worry of large corps. storing our search queries.
